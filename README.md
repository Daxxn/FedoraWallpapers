# Fedora Wallpaper Manager

Fedora doesnt come with a built in way to cycle through wallpapers.
This fixes that.

### Usage of the App:

Set a folder as the source.

Open a pictures folder and move the files over.

Save

### Usage of the Background Service:

Im still not sure how to get the service to start at reboot. (Working on it.)

It can be started from the terminal instead:
Run `./wpd/startupScript.sh`
